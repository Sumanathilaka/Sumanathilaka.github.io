            <h3>GlossGPT: GPT for Word Sense Disambiguation using Few-shot Chain-of-Thought Prompting</h3>
            <b>T Sumanathilaka</b>, Nicholas Micallef and Julian Hough
            <p class="venue">2025 8th International Conference on Emerging Data and Industry 4.0 (EDI40)| Procedia Computer Science | Apr 25</p>
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >Lexical ambiguity is a major challenge in computational linguistic tasks, as limitations in proper sense identification led to inefficient translation and question answering. General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly utilized for NLP tasks. However, utilizing general-purpose LLMs for specific tasks has been challenging, and fine-tuning has become a critical requirement for task specification. In this work, we craft advanced prompts with different contextual parameters to guide the model's inference towards accurate sense prediction to handle Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). We present a few-shot Chain of Thought (COT) prompt-based technique using GPT-4-Turbo with knowledgebase as a retriever that does not require fine-tuning the model for WSD tasks and sense definitions are supported by synonyms to broaden the lexical meaning. Our approach achieves comparable performance on the SemEval and Senseval datasets. More importantly, we set a new state-of-the-art performance with the few-shot FEWS dataset, breaking through the 90% F1 score barrier.</p>

            <h3>"If ChatGPT can do it, where is my creativity?’’ Generative AI boosts performance but diminishes experience in a creative writing task</h3>
            Peidong Mei, Deborah N. Brewis, Fortune Nwaiwu, <b>Deshan Sumanathilaka</b>,Fernando Alva-Manchego,Joanna Demaree-Cotton 
            <p class="venue">2025 Computers in Human Behavior: Artificial Humans Journal | Mar 25</p>
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >As generative AI (GenAI) becomes more sophisticated, it is increasingly being used as a tool to enhance creative expression and innovation. Along with its potential benefits, it is imperative that we examine pitfalls in how generative AI may affect the quality of creative thinking and possibly lead to a narrowing of diversity both in representation and thought. In this study, we employed an experimental design with 225 university students who completed a creative writing task with pre- and post-task surveys to assess ChatGPT's impact on their performance and experiences compared to a control group who did not use ChatGPT. Results show that using ChatGPT enhanced creativity of output and reduced the difficulty and effort required for the task, particularly for non-native English speakers. However, it also diminished the value and enjoyment of the task and raised moral concerns. We contribute to the nascent literature on GenAI by showing how ChatGPT assistance could potentially bolster human creativity by facilitating content delivery or providing useful counterpoint ideas. We also significantly advance scholarship on understanding experience of GenAI, demonstrating that bypassing the cognitive effort required for creativity by using ChatGPT could be harmful to the creative process and experience of creative tasks, especially when steps are not taken to address the use of AI in a transparent manner. Finally, our novel mixed-method study design offers a contribution to the methodological frameworks for the study of the effects and experience of GenAI. We discuss the study results in relation to implications for educational practices and social policy and argue that our results support recommending an integration of generative AI into higher education alongside practices that help to mitigate the negative impacts of AI use on student experience.</p>

            <h3>Exploring the Impact of Temperature on Large Language Models: A Case Study for Classification Task based on Word Sense Disambiguation</h3>
            <b>T Sumanathilaka</b>, Nicholas Micallef and Julian Hough
            <p class="venue">2025 7th International Conference on Natural Language Processing (ICNLP 2025) | Mar 2025</p>
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language (NL) related tasks have been evaluated and
 explored. While the impact of temperature on text generation in LLMs has been explored, its influence on classification tasks
 remains unexamined despite temperature being a key parameter for controlling response randomness and creativity. In this study,
 we investigated the effect of the model’s temperature on sense classification tasks for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). A
 carefully crafted Few-shot Chain of Thought (COT) prompt was used to conduct the study, and FEWS lexical knowledge was
 shared for the gloss identification task. GPT-3.5 and 4, LlaMa 3-70B and 3.1-70B, and Mixtral 8x22B have been used as the
 base models for the study, while evaluations are conducted with 0.2 intervals between the 0 to 1 range. The results demonstrate
 that temperature significantly affects the performance of LLMs in classification tasks, emphasizing the importance of conducting
 a preliminary study to select the optimal temperature for a task. The results show that GPT-3.5-Turbo and Llama-3.1-70B models
 have a clear performance shift, the Mixtral 8x22B model with minor deviations, while GPT-4-Turbo and LlaMa-3-70B models produce consistent results at different temperatures.</p>

            <h3>SSL400 - A Comprehensive Word Level Dataset for Sinhala Sign Language Recognition</h3>
            Yohan Abhishek, <b>T Sumanathilaka</b>
            <p class="venue">2025 5th International Conference on Advanced Research in Computing (ICARC) - IEEE | Feb 25</p>
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" > <div class="links"> In the context of increasing digital accessibility and the need for inclusive communication technologies, the demand for automated sign language recognition has grown significantly. However, Sinhala Sign Language (SSL), used by the Sri Lankan deaf community, remains underexplored due to the lack of labelled datasets and the challenges of developing recognition models for low-resource languages. This study addresses this gap by introducing an SSL dataset, specifically curated to support real-time recognition of 384 commonly used words in daily and work-related contexts. The methodology for dataset creation involved expert consultations, a structured data collection process, and multi-step labelling. These steps ensured the accurate labeling of video data, which can be used for machine learning tasks like gesture recognition, sentence formation, and speech translation. The proposed dataset lays the foundation for SSL recognition models that are fast, lightweight, and optimized for low-resource environments. Additionally, we explore the performance of initial recognition models using this dataset, demonstrating its applicability in real world scenarios. The dataset and research outcomes provide valuable resources for the development of inclusive AI-driven communication tools for the Sinhala-speaking deaf community. This contribution addresses the pressing need for better technological support for underrepresented languages in the field of sign language recognition and processing.

            <p class="venue">2025 5th International Conference on Advanced Research in Computing (ICARC) - IEEE | Feb 25</p>
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" > <div class="links"> The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, GPT-4, LlaMA, and mBERT has significantly advanced the natural language processing (NLP) field across many widely spoken languages. However, the effectiveness of these LLMs on low-resource languages such as Sinhala remained unexplored. With the scarcity of high-quality data and linguistic resources, fine-tuning LLMs in Sinhala has gained significant challenges. With a focus on Sinhala specifically, this systematic review addresses the methodologies and outcomes of adapting large language models for underrepresented languages. The purpose of this review is to synthesize existing research, identify effective strategies, contributions, and improvements, and highlight the challenges and opportunities in this domain. By analyzing various approaches, including data augmentation, transfer learning, cross-lingual transfer, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, adapter tuning, and model adaptation likewise, this review provides a comprehensive and precise idea of the current state of LLM fine-tuning on low-resource languages like Sinhala. The results highlight the importance of using creative methods and collaboration to improve LLM performance and usefulness in linguistic environments with limited resources.

            <h3>Recent Trends and Challenges in Assistive Applications for Sinhala-Speaking Adults with Dyslexia: A Decade in Review</h3>
            Peshala Perera, <b>T Sumanathilaka</b>
            <p class="venue">2025 5th International Conference on Advanced Research in Computing (ICARC) - IEEE | Feb 25</p>
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" > <div class="links"> This paper discusses assistive technologies developed for Sinhala-speaking individuals with dyslexia. It looks at the challenges these individuals face and how existing tools attempt to address them. The discussion highlights the potential for such technologies to improve literacy and independence while pointing out areas where more work is needed to create better support systems. Dyslexia, a learning difficulty that makes it difficult for individuals to understand language, causes considerable difficulty in languages with complex spelling such as the Sinhala language. Even in the present era of the availability of novel techniques for English language learners, Sinhala-speaking adults with dyslexia are still ignored a lot which again proves the need for a localized approach. PRISMA was used as a formal framework for data collection in this review. The analysis focused on the latest research publications from 2015 to 2024, covering topics such as phonetic processing, text normalization, error detection, and the application of these techniques in assistive technologies. A total of 95 papers were initially reviewed, of which 32 were selected for inclusion in the meta-review. The selected studies contributed to a comprehensive understanding of the role of these techniques in supporting assistive applications. Importantly, several shortcomings were found,thescarcityofannotateddatasetsandthelackofNLPresourcesdesignedfortheclient-adultpatients’cognitionandlanguageprofiles. Recommendations include focusing more on expanding mainly low-resource language toolkits and the smooth integration of assistive NLP applications. More so, it calls for the partnership of various disciplines to enhance continued progress in the enhancement of literacy, independence, and overall social participation among Sinhala-speaking adults with dyslexia through assistive technology.

            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" > <div class="links"> This study Rasathura explores the emotional dimensions of Sri Lankan music, specifically Sinhala songs, by developing an emotional classification model using both audio features and lyrical analysis. The research addresses the limitations in emotional classification using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for Sinhala music. For audio analysis, JAudio was used to extract musical data, and machine learning (ML) techniques, including Random Forest, Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, were evaluated for classification. Relief-based and correlation-based attribute selection were utilized to enhance classification accuracy. The SMO algorithm achieved an accuracy of 75.92% using JAudio features, which increased to 79.01% with Relief-based attribute selection. The BERT model (built on XLM-RoBERTa) was used for lyrical analysis, achieving a maximum accuracy of 61.22%. TFIDF, Word2Vec with n-grams, and BERT embeddings were evaluated for feature extraction in lyrical data. The findings could benefit the future music industry by creating personalized music recommendation systems, enhancing music therapy applications, and contributing to preserving cultural heritage through digital music archiving.

            <p class="venue">2025 The First Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Indo-Aryan and Dravidian Languages | Jan 25</p>
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >The Romanized text has become popular with the growth of digital communication platforms, largely due to the familiarity with English keyboards.
In Sri Lanka, Romanized Sinhala, commonly referred to as “Singlish” is widely used in digital communications.
This paper introduces a novel context-aware back-transliteration system designed to address the ad-hoc typing patterns and lexical ambiguity inherent in Singlish.
The proposed system combines dictionary-based mapping for Singlish words, a rule-based transliteration for out-of-vocabulary words and a BERT-based language model for addressing lexical ambiguities. Evaluation results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach, achieving high BLEU scores along with low Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER) across test datasets. This study provides an effective solution for Romanized Sinhala back-transliteration and establishes the foundation for improving NLP tools for similar low-resourced languages.</p>

            Assessing GPT’s Potential for Word Sense Disambiguation: A Quantitative Evaluation on Prompt Engineering Techniques</h3>
            <b>T Sumanathilaka</b>, Nicholas Micallef and Julian Hough
            <p class="venue">2024 IEEE 15th Control and System Graduate Research Colloquium (ICSGRC) | IEEE | Aug 24</p>
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >Modern digital communications (including social media content) often contain 
ambiguous words due to their potential for multiple related interpretations 
(polysemy). This ambiguity poses challenges for traditional Word Sense 
Disambiguation (WSD) methods, which struggle with limited data and lack of 
contextual understanding. These limitations hinder efficient translation, information 
retrieval, and question-answering systems, thereby restricting the benefits of 
computational linguistics techniques when applied to digital communication 
technologies. Our research investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to 
improve WSD using various prompt engineering techniques. We propose and evaluate 
a novel method that combines a knowledge graph, together with Part-of-Speech (POS) 
tagging and few-shot prompting to guide LLMs. By utilizing prompt augmentation with 
human-in-loop on few-shot prompt approaches, this work demonstrates a substantial 
improvement in WSD. This research advances accurate word interpretation in digital 
communications, leading to important implications for improved translation systems, 
better search results, and more intelligent question-answering technology.</p>

            <h3>TAMZi!: Shorthand Romanized Tamil to Tamil Reverse Transliteration Using Novel Hybrid Approach</h3>
            Anuja Herath Mudiyanselage, <b>T Sumanathilaka</b>
            <p class="venue">2024 The International Journal on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions (ICTer)</p>
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >Transliteration from Tamil to the Roman script holds a crucial place in the realms of effective communication, educational accessibility, and the seamless integration of digital technology. However, this process encounters a significant challenge due to the disparity in the number of vowels between the Tamil script, which encompasses a rich set of 12 vowels, and the Roman script, which is limited to just 5. This incongruity poses a substantial impediment when attempting ad-hoc transliteration of Tamil into the Roman script, especially when vowels are omitted. This paper aims to make a significant academic contribution by conducting an extensive literature review of recent developments in Romanized Tamil to Tamil transliteration, with a particular focus on addressing the absence of vowels. The review involves a meticulous examination of a wide array of methodologies proposed in recent years, ranging from rule-based systems to context-based strategies and machine learning-based approaches. In response to the challenges inherent in Tamil to Roman transliteration, this research work introduces a novel and innovative solution. This solution incorporates a Reverse Transliteration module, which leverages N-gram analysis and a rule-based model. The utilization of a trained trie structure is a key component of this approach, enabling word suggestions that effectively resolve ambiguities during the transliteration process. Remarkably, the proposed solution outperforms existing character-level transliteration methods, achieving an impressive character-level accuracy rate of 0.93. The practical implications of this research are substantial, particularly concerning the fulfilment of the linguistic and transliteration needs of native Tamil speakers within the digital platform, where such accuracy is of utmost importance.</p>

            <h3>Swa Bhasha 2.0: Addressing Ambiguities in Romanized Sinhala to Native Sinhala Transliteration Using Neural Machine Translation.</h3>
            Sachithya Dharmasiri, <b>T Sumanathilaka</b>
            <p class="venue">2024 4th International Conference on Advanced Research in Computing (ICARC) | IEEE | Feb 24</p>
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >With the growing popularity of social media and instantaneous messaging, it is more important than ever to interact online in your native language. In Sinhala, both Romanized and native Sinhala are widely used. Due to the informal textual abbreviation known as “Singlish” however, attempts to translate Romanized Sinhala into native Sinhala via machine transliteration may result in errors. Rule-based transliteration systems may not be compatible with the ad hoc transliterations used in Singlish. To translate Romanized Sinhala back precisely and consistently into Native Sinhala, a novel NMT approach has been proposed. To address the complexities of casual Romanized Sinhala, a hybrid strategy combining rule-based and neural machine translation has been proposed. This strategy aims to eliminate word selection ambiguity by selecting the best word suggestions from a pool of predicted words using a suggestion algorithm. Combining the advantages of Suggestion algorithms and neural machine translation, the proposed transliterator has the potential to considerably enhance reverse transliteration and improve communication in native Sinhala by combining the strengths of both approaches. After completing the GRU model, the performance of the machine translation models on the BLEU test improved to 0.8, indicating high word-level translation accuracy. Significant potential exists for the proposed transliterator to enhance reverse transliteration and improve communication in Sinhala. While preliminary test results are promising, additional testing and refinement are required to improve the overall efficacy of machine translation models.</p>

            Vathila De Silva, <b>T Sumanathilaka</b>
            <p class="venue">2024 4th International Conference on Advanced Research in Computing (ICARC) | IEEE | Feb 24</p>
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >Recent years have seen the emergence of image captioning as a revolutionary technical development that seamlessly blends computer vision and natural language processing. The integration of various domains facilitates the production of captivating captions for pictures, promoting a more profound comprehension of visual material. This study offers a thorough analysis of the rapidly developing field of image captioning, examining its uses in various settings such as social media, online platforms, assistive technology, and content indexing. It emphasizes the critical importance of advanced techniques like You Only Look Once (YOLO) for accurate item detection and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for creating subtle captions. While NLP gives the resulting text a layer of contextual depth, YOLO guarantees precise object detection, which helps with caption accuracy.

            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >In the context of a changing society and rapid technological advancements, the prevalence of social media platforms and instant messaging services has significantly strengthened the usage of native languages. In Sri Lanka, Sinhala and Romanized Sinhala have emerged as popular typing languages, owing to the widespread use of informal shorthand-based typing and internet acronyms for quicker communication. However, due to the limited availability of resources, linguistic support for these languages is limited, making them low-resource languages. To address this resource deficit, this study proposes the development of a rule-based transliteration tool that can annotate Sinhala words into Romanized Sinhala, accommodating the diverse ad hoc typing patterns used by the community. The research approach involved a comprehensive survey employing a stratified sampling method, considering variables such as age, gender, and language proficiency. 215 participants were presented with an online survey comprising 12 Sinhala sentences to capture various transliteration patterns related to Sinhala characters which are necessary for the annotation process. Analysis of the survey responses led to the formulation of 92 general rules and 26 special rules, encapsulating ad-hoc Romanized Sinhala typing patterns. Using these rules, Sinhala dictionaries were annotated, building a large corpus of data which consists of Sinhala and its Romanized Sinhala patterns. The annotated dataset was validated using a back transliteration tool, achieving an 84%-word accuracy rate. This innovative transliteration annotator can be used to mitigate the resource constraints associated with Sinhala to Romanized Sinhala transliteration.</p>

            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >Machine Transliteration provides the ability to transliterate a basic language into different languages in a computational way. Transliteration is an important technical process that has caught the attention most recently. The Sinhala transliteration has many constraints because of the insufficiency of resources in the Sinhala language. Due to these limitations, Sinhala Transliteration is highly complex and time-consuming. Therefore, the majority of the Sri Lankans uses non-formal texting language named 'Singlish' to make that process simple. This study has focused on the transliteration of the Singlish language at the word level by reducing the complication in the transliteration. A new approach of coding system has invented with the rule-based approach that can map the matching Sinhala words even without the vowels. Various typing patterns were collected by different communities for this. The collected data have analyzed with every Sinhala character and unique Singlish patterns related to them were generated. The system has introduced a newly initiated numeric coding system to use with the Singlish letters by matching with the recognized typing patterns. For the mapping process, fuzzy logic-based implementation has used. A codified dictionary has also implemented including unique numeric values. In this system, Each Romanized English letter was assigned with a unique numeric code that can construct a unique pattern for each word. The system can identify the most relevant Sinhala word that matches with the pattern of the Singlish word or it gives the most related word suggestions. For example, the word 'kiyanna,kianna, kynna, kynn, kiynna' have mapped with the accurate Sinhala word "kiyanna". These results revealed that the 'Swa Bhasha' transliteration system has the ability to enhance the Sinhala users' experience while conducting the texting in Singlish to Sinhala.</p>

            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify">With the revolution of social technology, the introduction of social media platforms and instant messages strengthen the native language used for communication in electronic media. With the commencement of multi-language compatibility in the digital arena both native Sinhala and Romanized Sinhala became prominent among the general community. Machine transliteration provides the ability to transliterate the alphabet of one language to another using computational approaches. The informal shorthand language that uses in texting also known as “Singlish” makes texting easier as the words in Sinhala can be interpreted using English letters with different typing patterns. But typing “Romanized Sinhala” using ad hoc transliterations and short net acronyms and getting the expected output in native Sinhala is less accurate. The current transliterators with a rule-based approach use a letter-level transliteration with a defined rule for the transliteration schema. But Romanized Sinhala via shortened hand based typing is not compatible with the current system. The proposed ad-hoc schema uses multiple computational approaches Aka Hybrid Approach to accomplish the requirement of ambiguity-free transliteration. The statistical approach used in the first phase uses an N-gram tagger where the tokens are fed to Trigram, Bigram, and Unigram taggers respectively. The unknown token from the initial phase is fed to the second phase with a Rule-based Algorithm which will predict respective words. The third phase which is the finalizing phase uses a suggestion-level model implemented using a Trie and Knowledge base to find the most optimal word suggestions from the predicted words pool. This phase will solve the ambiguity of a word selection. The Transliterator has been tested with the testing data and word level accuracy achieved was 84%. Therefore, the proposed novel transliterator which can back transliterate Romanized Sinhala to Sinhala using the Hybrid approach can use to enhance the reverse transliteration schema which will escalate the usage of Native Sinhala for communication</p>
