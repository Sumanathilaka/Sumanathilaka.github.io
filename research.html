            <h3>Hate Speech Detection in Romanized Sinhala Text using Multilingual Transformer Models</h3>
            Sakun Chamikara, <b>T Sumanathilaka</b>
            <p class="venue">2026 6th International Conference on Advanced Research in Computing (ICARC) - IEEE | Feb 26</p>
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" > 
            Social media has become a key platform for communication, but it has also amplified the spread of hate speech, particularly in languages and dialects that lack digital resources and support. One such case is Romanized Sinhala, an informal writing style commonly used by Sri Lankans. Its irregular spelling, use of phonetic forms, and mixing with English present serious challenges for automatic hate speech detection. This project explores a deep learning-based solution to detect hate speech written in Romanized Sinhala, with the aim of strengthening online safety in low resource language settings. To build the system, the SOLD (Sinhala Offensive Language Dataset) was transliterated into Romanized Sinhala using a custom pipeline. Several state-of-the-art multilingual transformer models, including XLM-RoBERTa, IndicBERT, and distil-mBERT, were evaluated to identify the most effective approach. Among them, multilingual BERT (mBERT) achieved the best performance, with an accuracy of 81.28%, F1-score of 0.78, and recall of 0.81 after fine-tuning on the Romanized dataset. These findings highlight that pre-trained multilingual models, when adapted appropriately, can be effective even for languages with limited digital infrastructure. Beyond technical outcomes, this project has broader social relevance. It provides a foundation for developing tools that can reduce harmful content in Sinhala-speaking online communities, support moderation efforts, and promote healthier digital spaces in Sri Lanka

            In multilingual societies, it is common to observe the blending of multiple languages in communication, a phenomenon known as Code Mixing. Globalization and the increasing influence of social media have further amplified multilingualism, resulting in a wider use of code-mixing. This systematic review analyzes existing translation and transliteration techniques for code-mixed Indo-Aryan languages, spanning rule-based and statistical approaches to neural machine translation and transformer-based architectures. It also examines publicly available code-mixed datasets designed for machine translation and transliteration tasks, along with the evaluation metrics commonly introduced and applied in prior studies. Finally, the paper discusses current challenges and limitations, highlighting future research directions for developing more tailored translation pipelines for code-mixed Indo-Aryan languages.

            <p class="venue">2025 | 7th International Conference On Advancements In Computing 2025 | Dec 2025</p>
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" > 
            Adverse Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) pose a critical challenge under polypharmacy. Traditional methods, such as rule-based systems and classical machine learning approaches, struggle with scalability and the detection of novel interactions in free-text biomedical literature. To address these limitations, the proposed framework PHARMAMAP–LLM introduces a DDI extraction system that instruction-tunes a biomedical large language model (LLM) via QLoRA for memory-efficient domain adaptation on a single RTX 3090 GPU. The system employs an agentic flow comprising a Predictor (MedLLaMA-3-8B), two Validators, and a clinician-facing Risk Agent, enabling predictions, confidence scores, and rationales to be cross-checked for enhanced explainability. Training utilizes the DDIExtraction 2013 corpus and an instruction dataset derived from approximately 20,000 DrugBank pairs, with entity normalization handled using a SciBERT tokenizer. Detailed hardware specifications and training parameters—including learning rate, LoRA ranks, and batch/sequence sizes—are reported to ensure reproducibility. On the DDIExtraction 2013 benchmark, PHARMAMAP–LLM achieves an F1-score of 0.87, Precision of 0.89, and Recall of 0.85, outperforming prior text-mining baselines. A human evaluation by a clinical pharmacologist across 200 cases rated 83% of responses as accurate or better (mean 4.2/5), while an LLM-as-judge audit using GPT-4 on 2,000 outputs found 92.3% correctness. When compared with GPT-4o on 500 shared prompts, performance differences were statistically insignificant according to McNemar’s χ² test (continuity-corrected, p ≈ 0.40). Error analysis revealed under-detection of pharmacodynamic interaction patterns and missing dose/time qualifiers, which informed mitigation strategies including PD-focused exemplars, retrieval of threshold cues, and calibrated confidence scoring. Overall, the proposed system delivers an explainable, reproducible, and deployment-friendly DDI tool designed to enhance clinical decision support. <div class="links">

            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" > 
            Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped the landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Among the various prompting techniques, few-shot prompting has gained considerable attention for its practicality and effectiveness. This study investigates how few-shot prompting strategies impact the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task, particularly focusing on the biases introduced by imbalanced sample distributions. We use the GLOSSGPT prompting method, an advanced approach for English WSD, to test its effectiveness across five languages: English, German, Spanish, French, and Italian. Our results show that imbalanced few-shot examples can cause incorrect sense predictions in multilingual languages, but this issue does not appear in English. To assess model behavior, we evaluate both the GPT-4o and LLaMA-3.1-70B models and the results highlight the sensitivity of multilingual WSD to sample distribution in few-shot settings, emphasizing the need for balanced and representative prompting strategies. </p>

            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" > Deep Learning and, more recently, Large Language Models(LLMs) have revolutionised the field of artificial intelligence and have been successfully employed in many disciplines, capturing widespread attention and enthusiasm.Many previous studies have established that domain-specific Deep Learning models competitively perform with the general-purpose LLMs. However, a suitable prompt which provides direct instructions and background information is expected to yield improved results.
            The present study, which focuses on Large Language Models for Toponym Resolution, shows that effective Prompt Engineering techniques without fine-tuning or pre-training approaches enable LLMs to surpass Deep Learning models, which is contrary to the initial expectations. After a comparison of open-source and proprietary LLMs and different prompt engineering techniques, the GPT-4o model performs best compared to the other open-source LLMs</p>

            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" > This paper introduces the first Transliteration disambiguation (TD) dataset for Romanized Sinhala, informally known as Singlish, developed to address the challenge of transliteration ambiguity in backwards transliteration tasks. The dataset covers 22 ambiguous Romanized Sinhala words, each mapping to two distinct Sinhala meanings, and provides 30 Romanized sentences per word: ten for each meaning individually and ten containing both meanings in context. Sentences were initially collected through web scraping and later post-processed using the Claude language model, which offers strong support for Sinhala, alongside a rule-based Romanization process to ensure linguistic quality and consistency. To demonstrate its applicability, the dataset was used to evaluate four existing back-transliteration systems, highlighting their performance in resolving context-sensitive ambiguities. Baseline evaluations confirm the dataset’s effectiveness in assessing transliteration systems’ ability to handle transliteration ambiguity, offering a valuable resource for advancing TD and transliteration research for Sinhala.

            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >The growth of mobile financial transactions presents new challenges for fraud detection, where traditional and ML methods often miss emerging patterns. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer advanced language understanding, they are typically too resource-intensive for mobile deployment and raise privacy concerns due to cloud reliance. This paper proposes a lightweight, privacy-preserving approach by fine-tuning and quantizing compact LLMs for on-device fraud detection from textual data. Models were optimized using Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) conversion and quantization to ensure efficiency. The fine-tuned quantized Llama-160M-Chat-v1 (bnb4) achieved 99.47% accuracy with a 168MB footprint, while fine-tuned quantized Qwen1.5-0.5B-Chat (bnb4) reached 99.50% accuracy at 797MB. These results demonstrate that optimized LLMs can deliver accurate, real-time fraud detection on mobile devices without compromising user privacy.

            <p class="venue">2025 Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing (RANLP) | Sep 25</p>
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >Dyslexia in adults remains an under-researched and under-served area, particularly in non-English-speaking contexts, despite its significant impact on personal and professional lives. This work addresses that gap by focusing on Sinhala, a low-resource language with limited tools for linguistic accessibility. We present an assistive system explicitly designed for Sinhala-speaking adults with dyslexia. The system integrates Whisper for speech-to-text conversion, SinBERT, an open-sourced fine-tuned BERT model trained for Sinhala to identify common dyslexic errors, and a combined mT5 and Mistral-based model to generate corrected text. Finally, the output is converted back to speech using gTTS, creating a complete multimodal feedback loop. Despite the challenges posed by limited Sinhala-language datasets, the system achieves 0.66 transcription accuracy and 0.7 correction accuracy with 0.65 overall system accuracy. These results demonstrate both the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. Ultimately, this work highlights the importance of inclusive Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies in underrepresented languages and showcases a practical step toward improving accessibility for adult dyslexic users. </p>

            <h3>End-to-End Sign Language Recognition Pipeline: Towards Energy Efficient Modeling</h3>
            Yohan Abhishek, <b>T Sumanathilaka</b>
            <p class="venue">2025 The 15th International Conference on Sustainable Energy Information Technology (SEIT 2025)| Procedia Computer Science | Aug 25</p>
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >Sign Language Recognition (SLR) plays a crucial role in enhancing communication accessibility for deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. This paper introduces an energy-efficient, end-to-end SLR pipeline optimized for real-time edge deployment. Our approach centers on a novel hybrid architecture that integrates MaskedConv1D layers with a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network, further enhanced by an attention mechanism to effectively extract and leverage spatio-temporal features from sign gesture sequences. The pipeline incorporates a robust preprocessing module utilizing MediaPipe-based landmark extraction and a selective temporal sampling strategy, which together reduce input redundancy while preserving critical gesture dynamics. Additionally, a lightweight, prompt-driven language model is employed for on-the-fly grammatical correction and translation, ensuring high semantic fidelity under computational constraints. Experimental evaluations on the SSL400 dataset demonstrate competitive
classification accuracy, low computational overhead, and high inference speed, making the system well-suited for resource-limited edge devices. These contributions provide a scalable foundation for practical SLR applications and highlight future enhancements
in multimodal fusion and on-device language processing.

            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >Lexical ambiguity is a major challenge in computational linguistic tasks, as limitations in proper sense identification led to inefficient translation and question answering. General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly utilized for NLP tasks. However, utilizing general-purpose LLMs for specific tasks has been challenging, and fine-tuning has become a critical requirement for task specification. In this work, we craft advanced prompts with different contextual parameters to guide the model's inference towards accurate sense prediction to handle Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). We present a few-shot Chain of Thought (COT) prompt-based technique using GPT-4-Turbo with knowledgebase as a retriever that does not require fine-tuning the model for WSD tasks and sense definitions are supported by synonyms to broaden the lexical meaning. Our approach achieves comparable performance on the SemEval and Senseval datasets. More importantly, we set a new state-of-the-art performance with the few-shot FEWS dataset, breaking through the 90% F1 score barrier.</p>

            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >As generative AI (GenAI) becomes more sophisticated, it is increasingly being used as a tool to enhance creative expression and innovation. Along with its potential benefits, it is imperative that we examine pitfalls in how generative AI may affect the quality of creative thinking and possibly lead to a narrowing of diversity both in representation and thought. In this study, we employed an experimental design with 225 university students who completed a creative writing task with pre- and post-task surveys to assess ChatGPT's impact on their performance and experiences compared to a control group who did not use ChatGPT. Results show that using ChatGPT enhanced creativity of output and reduced the difficulty and effort required for the task, particularly for non-native English speakers. However, it also diminished the value and enjoyment of the task and raised moral concerns. We contribute to the nascent literature on GenAI by showing how ChatGPT assistance could potentially bolster human creativity by facilitating content delivery or providing useful counterpoint ideas. We also significantly advance scholarship on understanding experience of GenAI, demonstrating that bypassing the cognitive effort required for creativity by using ChatGPT could be harmful to the creative process and experience of creative tasks, especially when steps are not taken to address the use of AI in a transparent manner. Finally, our novel mixed-method study design offers a contribution to the methodological frameworks for the study of the effects and experience of GenAI. We discuss the study results in relation to implications for educational practices and social policy and argue that our results support recommending an integration of generative AI into higher education alongside practices that help to mitigate the negative impacts of AI use on student experience.</p>

 explored. While the impact of temperature on text generation in LLMs has been explored, its influence on classification tasks
 remains unexamined despite temperature being a key parameter for controlling response randomness and creativity. In this study,
 we investigated the effect of the model’s temperature on sense classification tasks for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). A
 carefully crafted Few-shot Chain of Thought (COT) prompt was used to conduct the study, and FEWS lexical knowledge was
 shared for the gloss identification task. GPT-3.5 and 4, LlaMa 3-70B and 3.1-70B, and Mixtral 8x22B have been used as the
 base models for the study, while evaluations are conducted with 0.2 intervals between the 0 to 1 range. The results demonstrate
 that temperature significantly affects the performance of LLMs in classification tasks, emphasizing the importance of conducting
 a preliminary study to select the optimal temperature for a task. The results show that GPT-3.5-Turbo and Llama-3.1-70B models
 have a clear performance shift, the Mixtral 8x22B model with minor deviations, while GPT-4-Turbo and LlaMa-3-70B models produce consistent results at different temperatures.</p>

            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" > <div class="links"> In the context of increasing digital accessibility and the need for inclusive communication technologies, the demand for automated sign language recognition has grown significantly. However, Sinhala Sign Language (SSL), used by the Sri Lankan deaf community, remains underexplored due to the lack of labelled datasets and the challenges of developing recognition models for low-resource languages. This study addresses this gap by introducing an SSL dataset, specifically curated to support real-time recognition of 384 commonly used words in daily and work-related contexts. The methodology for dataset creation involved expert consultations, a structured data collection process, and multi-step labelling. These steps ensured the accurate labeling of video data, which can be used for machine learning tasks like gesture recognition, sentence formation, and speech translation. The proposed dataset lays the foundation for SSL recognition models that are fast, lightweight, and optimized for low-resource environments. Additionally, we explore the performance of initial recognition models using this dataset, demonstrating its applicability in real world scenarios. The dataset and research outcomes provide valuable resources for the development of inclusive AI-driven communication tools for the Sinhala-speaking deaf community. This contribution addresses the pressing need for better technological support for underrepresented languages in the field of sign language recognition and processing.

With a focus on Sinhala specifically, this systematic review addresses the methodologies and outcomes of adapting large language models for underrepresented languages. The purpose of this review is to synthesize existing research, identify effective strategies, contributions, and improvements, and highlight the challenges and opportunities in this domain. By analyzing various approaches, including data augmentation, transfer learning, cross-lingual transfer, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, adapter tuning, and model adaptation likewise, this review provides a comprehensive and precise idea of the current state of LLM fine-tuning on low-resource languages like Sinhala. The results highlight the importance of using creative methods and collaboration to improve LLM performance and usefulness in linguistic environments with limited resources.

            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" > <div class="links"> This paper discusses assistive technologies developed for Sinhala-speaking individuals with dyslexia. It looks at the challenges these individuals face and how existing tools attempt to address them. The discussion highlights the potential for such technologies to improve literacy and independence while pointing out areas where more work is needed to create better support systems. Dyslexia, a learning difficulty that makes it difficult for individuals to understand language, causes considerable difficulty in languages with complex spelling such as the Sinhala language. Even in the present era of the availability of novel techniques for English language learners, Sinhala-speaking adults with dyslexia are still ignored a lot which again proves the need for a localized approach. PRISMA was used as a formal framework for data collection in this review. The analysis focused on the latest research publications from 2015 to 2024, covering topics such as phonetic processing, text normalization, error detection, and the application of these techniques in assistive technologies. A total of 95 papers were initially reviewed, of which 32 were selected for inclusion in the meta-review. The selected studies contributed to a comprehensive understanding of the role of these techniques in supporting assistive applications. Importantly, several shortcomings were found,thescarcityofannotateddatasetsandthelackofNLPresourcesdesignedfortheclient-adultpatients’cognitionandlanguageprofiles. Recommendations include focusing more on expanding mainly low-resource language toolkits and the smooth integration of assistive NLP applications. More so, it calls for the partnership of various disciplines to enhance continued progress in the enhancement of literacy, independence, and overall social participation among Sinhala-speaking adults with dyslexia through assistive technology.

            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" > <div class="links"> This study Rasathura explores the emotional dimensions of Sri Lankan music, specifically Sinhala songs, by developing an emotional classification model using both audio features and lyrical analysis. The research addresses the limitations in emotional classification using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for Sinhala music. For audio analysis, JAudio was used to extract musical data, and machine learning (ML) techniques, including Random Forest, Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, were evaluated for classification. Relief-based and correlation-based attribute selection were utilized to enhance classification accuracy. The SMO algorithm achieved an accuracy of 75.92% using JAudio features, which increased to 79.01% with Relief-based attribute selection. The BERT model (built on XLM-RoBERTa) was used for lyrical analysis, achieving a maximum accuracy of 61.22%. TFIDF, Word2Vec with n-grams, and BERT embeddings were evaluated for feature extraction in lyrical data. The findings could benefit the future music industry by creating personalized music recommendation systems, enhancing music therapy applications, and contributing to preserving cultural heritage through digital music archiving.

            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >The Romanized text has become popular with the growth of digital communication platforms, largely due to the familiarity with English keyboards.
In Sri Lanka, Romanized Sinhala, commonly referred to as “Singlish” is widely used in digital communications.
This paper introduces a novel context-aware back-transliteration system designed to address the ad-hoc typing patterns and lexical ambiguity inherent in Singlish.
The proposed system combines dictionary-based mapping for Singlish words, a rule-based transliteration for out-of-vocabulary words and a BERT-based language model for addressing lexical ambiguities. Evaluation results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach, achieving high BLEU scores along with low Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER) across test datasets. This study provides an effective solution for Romanized Sinhala back-transliteration and establishes the foundation for improving NLP tools for similar low-resourced languages.</p>

            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >Modern digital communications (including social media content) often contain 
ambiguous words due to their potential for multiple related interpretations 
(polysemy). This ambiguity poses challenges for traditional Word Sense 
Disambiguation (WSD) methods, which struggle with limited data and lack of 
contextual understanding. These limitations hinder efficient translation, information 
retrieval, and question-answering systems, thereby restricting the benefits of 
computational linguistics techniques when applied to digital communication 
technologies. Our research investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to 
improve WSD using various prompt engineering techniques. We propose and evaluate 
a novel method that combines a knowledge graph, together with Part-of-Speech (POS) 
tagging and few-shot prompting to guide LLMs. By utilizing prompt augmentation with 
human-in-loop on few-shot prompt approaches, this work demonstrates a substantial 
improvement in WSD. This research advances accurate word interpretation in digital 
communications, leading to important implications for improved translation systems, 
better search results, and more intelligent question-answering technology.</p>

            <h3>TAMZi!: Shorthand Romanized Tamil to Tamil Reverse Transliteration Using Novel Hybrid Approach</h3>
            Anuja Herath Mudiyanselage, <b>T Sumanathilaka</b>
            <p class="venue">2024 The International Journal on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions (ICTer)</p>
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >Transliteration from Tamil to the Roman script holds a crucial place in the realms of effective communication, educational accessibility, and the seamless integration of digital technology. However, this process encounters a significant challenge due to the disparity in the number of vowels between the Tamil script, which encompasses a rich set of 12 vowels, and the Roman script, which is limited to just 5. This incongruity poses a substantial impediment when attempting ad-hoc transliteration of Tamil into the Roman script, especially when vowels are omitted. This paper aims to make a significant academic contribution by conducting an extensive literature review of recent developments in Romanized Tamil to Tamil transliteration, with a particular focus on addressing the absence of vowels. The review involves a meticulous examination of a wide array of methodologies proposed in recent years, ranging from rule-based systems to context-based strategies and machine learning-based approaches. In response to the challenges inherent in Tamil to Roman transliteration, this research work introduces a novel and innovative solution. This solution incorporates a Reverse Transliteration module, which leverages N-gram analysis and a rule-based model. The utilization of a trained trie structure is a key component of this approach, enabling word suggestions that effectively resolve ambiguities during the transliteration process. Remarkably, the proposed solution outperforms existing character-level transliteration methods, achieving an impressive character-level accuracy rate of 0.93. The practical implications of this research are substantial, particularly concerning the fulfilment of the linguistic and transliteration needs of native Tamil speakers within the digital platform, where such accuracy is of utmost importance.</p>

            <h3>Swa Bhasha 2.0: Addressing Ambiguities in Romanized Sinhala to Native Sinhala Transliteration Using Neural Machine Translation.</h3>
            Sachithya Dharmasiri, <b>T Sumanathilaka</b>
            <p class="venue">2024 4th International Conference on Advanced Research in Computing (ICARC) | IEEE | Feb 24</p>
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >With the growing popularity of social media and instantaneous messaging, it is more important than ever to interact online in your native language. In Sinhala, both Romanized and native Sinhala are widely used. Due to the informal textual abbreviation known as “Singlish” however, attempts to translate Romanized Sinhala into native Sinhala via machine transliteration may result in errors. Rule-based transliteration systems may not be compatible with the ad hoc transliterations used in Singlish. To translate Romanized Sinhala back precisely and consistently into Native Sinhala, a novel NMT approach has been proposed. To address the complexities of casual Romanized Sinhala, a hybrid strategy combining rule-based and neural machine translation has been proposed. This strategy aims to eliminate word selection ambiguity by selecting the best word suggestions from a pool of predicted words using a suggestion algorithm. Combining the advantages of Suggestion algorithms and neural machine translation, the proposed transliterator has the potential to considerably enhance reverse transliteration and improve communication in native Sinhala by combining the strengths of both approaches. After completing the GRU model, the performance of the machine translation models on the BLEU test improved to 0.8, indicating high word-level translation accuracy. Significant potential exists for the proposed transliterator to enhance reverse transliteration and improve communication in Sinhala. While preliminary test results are promising, additional testing and refinement are required to improve the overall efficacy of machine translation models.</p>

            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >In the context of a changing society and rapid technological advancements, the prevalence of social media platforms and instant messaging services has significantly strengthened the usage of native languages. In Sri Lanka, Sinhala and Romanized Sinhala have emerged as popular typing languages, owing to the widespread use of informal shorthand-based typing and internet acronyms for quicker communication. However, due to the limited availability of resources, linguistic support for these languages is limited, making them low-resource languages. To address this resource deficit, this study proposes the development of a rule-based transliteration tool that can annotate Sinhala words into Romanized Sinhala, accommodating the diverse ad hoc typing patterns used by the community. The research approach involved a comprehensive survey employing a stratified sampling method, considering variables such as age, gender, and language proficiency. 215 participants were presented with an online survey comprising 12 Sinhala sentences to capture various transliteration patterns related to Sinhala characters which are necessary for the annotation process. Analysis of the survey responses led to the formulation of 92 general rules and 26 special rules, encapsulating ad-hoc Romanized Sinhala typing patterns. Using these rules, Sinhala dictionaries were annotated, building a large corpus of data which consists of Sinhala and its Romanized Sinhala patterns. The annotated dataset was validated using a back transliteration tool, achieving an 84%-word accuracy rate. This innovative transliteration annotator can be used to mitigate the resource constraints associated with Sinhala to Romanized Sinhala transliteration.</p>

The Sinhala and the Romanized Sinhala became the prominent typing languages among the general Sri Lankan community. Informal short-hand-based typing and short net acronyms were used for easier Sinhala typing. But Typing Romanized Sinhala using ad-hoc transliterations and getting the expected output in native Sinhala is less accurate and time-consuming. Therefore, this study aims to introduce a novel reverse transliterator which can back transliterate and suggest Romanized Sinhala to Sinhala words. The Transliterator has been modelled using the Statistical approach with Trigram and Rule-based model for back transliteration purposes and knowledge-based with a Trie data structure for suggesting purposes. The proposed solution is capable of transliterating both formal and informal shorthand Romanized Sinhala. This hybrid model used in the study is capable of efficient transliteration with a word-level accuracy of 0.84. This proposed model can be used in digital platforms to enhance the usability of native Sinhala communication in a much more efficient way.</p>

            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >Digital image processing plays a crucial role in enabling efficient and precise analysis, manipulation, and enhancement of images. In this study, researchers address challenges faced by individuals with visual impairments in recognizing currency denominations and identifying counterfeit banknotes. The researchers propose "Blind Trust," an IoT device that utilizes an Arduino Uno and a camera module to capture images of banknotes. To achieve these objectives, researchers utilize pre-processing techniques using the OpenCV and TensorFlow libraries to extract the notes/coins' characteristics. Custom datasets are developed for training Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, which are then used to identify currency denominations and detect counterfeit currency. To enhance the model's performance, various pre-processing techniques are employed, resulting in high accuracy rates for both tasks. The currency notes identification model achieves an impressive 99% accuracy when tested on 25% of the data, while the currency coins identification model achieves 93% accuracy using InceptionV3. Additionally, the counterfeit currency detection model, created using VGG16, achieves an accuracy rate of 97% on a dataset comprising genuine and counterfeit currency images. Moreover, the note placement detection model attains 93% accuracy. "Blind Trust" holds great potential for enhancing financial security and accessibility for individuals with visual impairments. Its accuracy, speed, and ease of use contribute significantly to the development of new technologies aimed at improving their quality of life. Keywords—Arduino, CNN, Currency identification, Fake currency detection.</p>

            <h3>Swa Bhasha: Message-Based Singlish to Sinhala Transliteration.</h3>
            Maneesha Athukorala, <b>T Sumanathilaka</b>

            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify" >Machine Transliteration provides the ability to transliterate a basic language into different languages in a computational way. Transliteration is an important technical process that has caught the attention most recently. The Sinhala transliteration has many constraints because of the insufficiency of resources in the Sinhala language. Due to these limitations, Sinhala Transliteration is highly complex and time-consuming. Therefore, the majority of the Sri Lankans uses non-formal texting language named 'Singlish' to make that process simple. This study has focused on the transliteration of the Singlish language at the word level by reducing the complication in the transliteration. A new approach of coding system has invented with the rule-based approach that can map the matching Sinhala words even without the vowels. Various typing patterns were collected by different communities for this. The collected data have analyzed with every Sinhala character and unique Singlish patterns related to them were generated. The system has introduced a newly initiated numeric coding system to use with the Singlish letters by matching with the recognized typing patterns. For the mapping process, fuzzy logic-based implementation has used. A codified dictionary has also implemented including unique numeric values. In this system, Each Romanized English letter was assigned with a unique numeric code that can construct a unique pattern for each word. The system can identify the most relevant Sinhala word that matches with the pattern of the Singlish word or it gives the most related word suggestions. For example, the word 'kiyanna,kianna, kynna, kynn, kiynna' have mapped with the accurate Sinhala word "kiyanna". These results revealed that the 'Swa Bhasha' transliteration system has the ability to enhance the Sinhala users' experience while conducting the texting in Singlish to Sinhala.</p>

            <h3>Can Small Language Models Handle Context-Summarized Multi-Turn Customer-Service QA? A Synthetic Data-Driven Comparative Evaluation</h3>   
            Lakshan Cooray, <b>Deshan Sumanathilaka</b>, Pattigadapa Venkatesh Raju | 2026
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify">
            Customer-service question answering (QA) systems increasingly rely on conversational language understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance, their high computational cost and deployment constraints limit practical use in resource-constrained environments. Small Language Models (SLMs) provide a more efficient alternative, yet their effectiveness for multi-turn customer-service QA remains underexplored, particularly in scenarios requiring dialogue continuity and contextual understanding. This study investigates instruction-tuned SLMs for context-summarized multi-turn customer-service QA, using a history summarization strategy to preserve essential conversational state. We also introduce a conversation stage-based qualitative analysis to evaluate model behavior across different phases of customer-service interactions. Nine instruction-tuned low-parameterized SLMs are evaluated against three commercial LLMs using lexical and semantic similarity metrics alongside qualitative assessments, including human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Results show notable variation across SLMs, with some models demonstrating near-LLM performance, while others struggle to maintain dialogue continuity and contextual alignment. These findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of low-parameterized language models for real-world customer-service QA systems.

            <h3>Bridging Lexical Ambiguity and Vision: A Mini Review on Visual Word Sense Disambiguation</h3>   
            Shashini Nilukshi,<b>Deshan Sumanathilaka</b> | 2026      
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify">
            This paper offers a mini review of Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD), which is a multimodal extension of traditional Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). VWSD helps tackle lexical ambiguity in vision-language tasks. While conventional WSD depends only on text and lexical resources, VWSD uses visual cues to find the right meaning of ambiguous words with minimal text input. The review looks at developments from early multimodal fusion methods to new frameworks that use contrastive models like CLIP, diffusion-based text-to-image generation, and large language model (LLM) support. Studies from 2016 to 2025 are examined to show the growth of VWSD through feature-based, graph-based, and contrastive embedding techniques. It focuses on prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and adapting to multiple languages. Quantitative results show that CLIP-based fine-tuned models and LLM-enhanced VWSD systems consistently perform better than zero-shot baselines, achieving gains of up to 6-8% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). However, challenges still exist, such as limitations in context, model bias toward common meanings, a lack of multilingual datasets, and the need for better evaluation frameworks. The analysis highlights the growing overlap of CLIP alignment, diffusion generation, and LLM reasoning as the future path for strong, context-aware, and multilingual disambiguation systems.

            <p class="venue">Thesis for Master in Computer Science  Advisor: Dr Ruvan Weerasinghe, Mr Prasan Yapa 2022</p>
            <p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify">With the revolution of social technology, the introduction of social media platforms and instant messages strengthen the native language used for communication in electronic media. With the commencement of multi-language compatibility in the digital arena both native Sinhala and Romanized Sinhala became prominent among the general community. Machine transliteration provides the ability to transliterate the alphabet of one language to another using computational approaches. The informal shorthand language that uses in texting also known as “Singlish” makes texting easier as the words in Sinhala can be interpreted using English letters with different typing patterns. But typing “Romanized Sinhala” using ad hoc transliterations and short net acronyms and getting the expected output in native Sinhala is less accurate. The current transliterators with a rule-based approach use a letter-level transliteration with a defined rule for the transliteration schema. But Romanized Sinhala via shortened hand based typing is not compatible with the current system. The proposed ad-hoc schema uses multiple computational approaches Aka Hybrid Approach to accomplish the requirement of ambiguity-free transliteration. The statistical approach used in the first phase uses an N-gram tagger where the tokens are fed to Trigram, Bigram, and Unigram taggers respectively. The unknown token from the initial phase is fed to the second phase with a Rule-based Algorithm which will predict respective words. The third phase which is the finalizing phase uses a suggestion-level model implemented using a Trie and Knowledge base to find the most optimal word suggestions from the predicted words pool. This phase will solve the ambiguity of a word selection. The Transliterator has been tested with the testing data and word level accuracy achieved was 84%. Therefore, the proposed novel transliterator which can back transliterate Romanized Sinhala to Sinhala using the Hybrid approach can use to enhance the reverse transliteration schema which will escalate the usage of Native Sinhala for communication</p>
